*In a room with no windows sits an KAI and ELANOR. There's a half empty box of tissues and by it a trash can filled with them.*

Kai: So Thursday night was the last time you saw Kenji Ishida?

Elanor: *sniffs and nods* Yes. After our fight, he stormed out. *cries again* I wish those weren't our last words.

Kai: What he say anything when he left?

Elanor: Nothing *sniff sniff*  When he's angry, he just shuts down. He becomes a statue, it's impossible to get through to him, he won't even look at you.

Kai: What do you do then?

Elanor: What can I do?! *yells back*
