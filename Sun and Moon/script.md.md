We think it's Elanor the whole time, but turns out they both conspired together.
Diane brought Ken to the street where Elanor drove the car.

Car used: coupe deville, black convertable cadillac

# Theme
Both Elanor and Diane feel invisible in their relationship. They feel resentment

> The polices ruled it as a suicide, but Ken's sister (Kisaki) thinks otherwise, thus hired Ramos to investigate.

## Deconstruct tropes
femme fatale => hopeless romantic
damsel in distress => the practical woman

# S 1: morning Elanor

> Est she's his wife
Elanor plays the part of a grieving widow well
ends with she reveals he knows he a mistress

*In a room with no windows sits an KAI and ELANOR. There's a half empty box of tissues and by it a trash can filled with them.*

Kai: So Thursday night was the last time you saw Kenji Ishida?

Elanor: *sniffs and nods* Yes. After our fight, he stormed out. *cries again* I wish those weren't our last words.

Kai: What he say anything when he left?

Elanor: Nothing *sniff sniff*  When he's angry, he just shuts down. He becomes a statue, it's impossible to get through to him, he won't even look at you.

Kai: What do you do then?

Elanor: What can I do?! *yells back* 

Kai: *startled by Elanor's response*

Elanor: It feels no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try. Our marriage is bonded to sail off the end of the earth.

Kai: Why do you say that?

Elanor: *cries, hiccups*. We've been struggling for a long time. *blows noses into tissue* It isn't suppose to be like this! When we first met, we were so right for each other. And in this vast world, we've found each other.

Kai: When do you two meet?

Elanor: Junior year...

Kai: So yo met in college?

Elanor: Highschool, we were each other's first... *paused* first and only.... *looks sternly at the table and grips into her tissue hard*

Kai: *pushes a cup to tea towards Elanor* take your time. And you guys have been together since then?

Elanor: *nods* We got married, straight after college. My parents loved him, and in their mind why wait. When you've found the one, that's it. 

Kai: Did you think he was the one?

Elanor: *long pause* I used to think... that I was so lucky. That the guy I liked, liked me back. I mean isn't that rare? Normally crushes are one sided. I saw all my friends in high school get their hearts broken so many times. But lately, I've been wondering if I've been missing out on life because we got lucky.

Kai: Why have you been wondering?

Elanor: Ken, though all these years he just kept on changing. Maybe it's because I'm an elementary school teacher, but I essentially feel like the same person year after year. And I feel that he just left me behind. He couldn't even wait for me, he had to die first.

Kai: Regarding that, do you think he's planned it?

Elanor: What do you mean? He killed himself, how could he have not planned it?!

Kai: Yes, the police ruled it as a suicide. There was a note, and __blank__ is a common method of death one can self administer. But his sister thinks otherwise. That's why I am talking to you today, to get a better understanding of the circumstances of your late husband's life.

Elanor: Kisaki has always had it out for me. At the funeral, she directly accused me. In front of the whole family.

Kai: What did she say?

Elanor:  *burst out into tears again* That I poisoned him out of jealousy, when I found out about his affair.

> Elanor doesn't come out straight to say it straight, it is revealed.
> Kai knew about Diane

# S 2: noon Diane
> Mentions lunch form Press
Starts to hint that Diane knows Elanor
We see that Diane was really in love with someone (with whom, it's never clarified).
We are starting suspect Diane too, because she talks about feeling resentment about the situation

*Diane sits cross legged with one of her legs swinging. She is fully dressed in black. On the table is a hat with a mesh vail. Kai enters the room with a brown bag.*

Kai: Are you sure you're not hungry? *takes a panini sandwich out of the bag* 

Diane: *wrinkles her nose and eyes the sandwich* No, I'm fine.

Kai: *raises half of the sandwich as if to toast, and her eyebrows* Next time, you're in the neighborhood. You must try Press, best panini shop in Queens.

Diane: I don't frequent this area often, but thank you. I'm sure you didn't have me come this far out for lunch.

Kai: Right, *opens their laptop*  

> Flashback: How Diane met Ken. She walked into him doing push ups on the pantry floor and steps on his hands by accident.
> Ken: *sees she has  puffy eyes* What happened?
> Diane: First first date fails. You know how it is on the apps...
> Ken: No, actually. I've never been on the apps
> Diane: Oh, really?
> Diane start telling him about her experience. Ken started living vicariously through Diane

> Kai: My friends tell me guys on the apps are the worst.
> Diane:  It's not just guys *raises her eyes at Kai*
> Kai: Oh...
> Diane: Women have ghosted me more, actually

# S 3: evening Elanor
> Shadow of Elanor and Diane walking on a tight stairwell, they notice each other and slows down. When they are on the same step the pause for a very long moment.


> Shows how Elanor was feeling about the whole situation
> Kai finally catches Elanor in a lie. Seems like we have the killer. Elanor is wearing a silk shaw.

 Elanor: it's just... we were going to work things out. He finally agree to see counseling together.

Kai: Uh no, not the one next door? She's a quack, just skip the formalities and go see the one in the basement if you really want to fix your marriage.

Kai: Did you kill Kenji Ishida?

Elanor: *looks down and diverts her gaze*

# S 4: night Diane
> Elanor's feelings from the last scene are reflected back
> Diane is wearing the same shaw as Elanor from the previous scene.

Diane: No, because I killed Kenji Ishida.

# S 5: 6am Kai solves the case

> Ends with Diane pulling up in a convertable. Reveals Elanor walking down the steps of of the agency, shows they are next to a marriage counseling therapist, and an adult toys store. Elanor kisses Diane.
