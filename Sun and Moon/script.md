We think it's Elanor the whole time, but turns out they both conspired together.
Diane brought Ken to the street where Elanor drove the car.

Car used: coupe deville, black convertable cadillac

# Theme
Both Elanor and Diane feel invisible in their relationship. They feel resentment

> The polices ruled it as a suicide, but Ken's sister (Kisaki) thinks otherwise, thus hired Ramos to investigate.

## Deconstruct tropes
femme fatale => hopeless romantic
damsel in distress => the practical woman

# S 1: morning Elanor

> Est she's his wife
Elanor plays the part of a grieving widow well
ends with she reveals he knows he a mistress

*In a room with no windows sits an KAI and ELANOR. There's a half empty box of tissues and by it a trash can filled with them.*

Kai: So Thursday night was the last time you saw Kenji Ishida?

Elanor: *sniffs and nods* Yes. After our fight, he stormed out. *cries again* I wish those weren't our last words.

Kai: What he say anything when he left?

Elanor: Nothing *sniff sniff*  When he's angry, he just shuts down. He becomes a statue, it's impossible to get through to him, he won't even look at you.

Kai: What do you do then?

Elanor: What can I do?! *yells back* 

Kai: *startled by Elanor's response*

Elanor: It feels no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try. Our marriage is bonded to sail off the end of the earth.

Kai: Why do you say that?

Elanor: *cries, hiccups*. We've been struggling for a long time. *blows noses into tissue* It isn't suppose to be like this! When we first met, we were so right for each other. And in this vast world, we've found each other.

Kai: When do you two meet?

Elanor: Junior year...

Kai: So yo met in college?

Elanor: Highschool, we were each other's first... *paused* first and only.... *looks sternly at the table and grips into her tissue hard*

Kai: *pushes a cup to tea towards Elanor* take your time. And you guys have been together since then?

Elanor: *nods* We got married, straight after college. My parents loved him, and in their mind why wait. When you've found the one, that's it. 

Kai: Did you think he was the one?

Elanor: *long pause* I used to think... that I was so lucky. That the guy I liked, liked me back. I mean isn't that rare? Normally crushes are one sided. I saw all my friends in high school get their hearts broken so many times. But lately, I've been wondering if I've been missing out on life because we got lucky.

Kai: Why have you been wondering?

Elanor: Ken, though all these years he just kept on changing. Maybe it's because I'm an elementary school teacher, but I essentially feel like the same person year after year. And I feel that he just left me behind. He couldn't even wait for me, he had to die first.

Kai: Regarding that, do you think he's planned it?

Elanor: What do you mean? He killed himself, how could he have not planned it?!

Kai: Yes, the police ruled it as a suicide. There was a note, and __blank__ is a common method of death one can self administer. But his sister thinks otherwise. That's why I am talking to you today, to get a better understanding of the circumstances of your late husband's life.

Elanor: Kisaki has always had it out for me. At the funeral, she directly accused me. In front of the whole family.

Kai: What did she say?

Elanor:  *burst out into tears again* That I poisoned him out of jealousy, when I found out about his affair.

> Elanor doesn't come out straight to say it straight, it is revealed.
> Kai knew about Diane

# S 2: noon Diane
> Mentions lunch form Press
Starts to hint that Diane knows Elanor
We see that Diane was really in love with someone (with whom, it's never clarified).
We are starting suspect Diane too, because she talks about feeling resentment about the situation

*Diane sits cross legged with one of her legs swinging. She is fully dressed in black. On the table is a hat with a mesh vail. Kai enters the room with a brown bag.*

Kai: Sure you're not hungry? *takes a panini sandwich out of the bag* 

Diane: *wrinkles her nose and eyes the sandwich* No, I'm fine.

Kai: *raises half of the sandwich as if to toast, and her eyebrows* Next time, you're in the neighborhood. You gotta try Press, best panini shop in Queens.

Diane: I don't frequent this area often, but thank you. I'm sure you didn't have me come this far out for lunch.

Kai: Right, *opens their laptop*  Can you tell me about, how you've come to know Kenji Ishida?

Diane: Our companies shared and office space. *sighs, she closes her eyes. A silent moment passes*

*In the silhouette  screen a female figure appears*

Diane: *finally opens her eyes, her gaze is far away. Almost excitedly she smiles,* I remember that morning, I went to the pantry to get a much needed coffee. Ken was doing push up on the floor, and without realizing my heel landed on his hand.

*Shadows: Diane falls as Ken flinches from the pain. She rushes to apologize, Ken laughs and motions he's fine. She laughs too.*

Diane: He kept on saying he was fine, just anxious about the investor meeting today. He even noticed my eyes were puffy and asked if I was ok. I said, 'just another first date fail, you know how it is on the apps'. He said he's never been on the apps, then started asking me about what they are like. And boy did I have a library of horror stories to tell.

Kai: I'm sorry, my friends tell me guys on the apps are the worst.

Diane:  It's not just guys *raises her eyes at Kai, and leans toward on desk*

Kai: Oh. *uncertain if Diane is trying to hit on them*

Diane: *pulls back towards her set, and returns to a normal tone* Kind of to think about it, women have ghosted me more.

> How Diane feel for Ken. She thought his relation was on the verge of ending

Kai: So from that day, you and Ken...

Diane: It was innocent at first, we were just pals. We mostly ate lunch together in the courtyard. Talked about the insanity that went on in our start ups. He wanted to hear about my dating life. I don't know why anyone would, it's pretty sad. *looks down* connecting to people is so hard, maybe it's just me. But talking to Ken, just feels so easy.

Kai: Did you have feelings for him then?

Diane: I don't know, maybe? When we first met in the pantry, I felt my heart flutter a bit. But it could have just been the situation. A clumsy meet cute, felt almost like we were in a rom-com. I guess something like that is hard to feel with someone you meet on the apps. Life has no happy accidents anymore. There's no magic.

Kai: And you want magic?

Diane: I want.... a good story.

Kai: So what is this story? He listened to your stories...

Diane: I think he liked them because he was living vicariously through me. He later opened up to tell me his own marriage was in shambles. And that his wife is about to leave him.

*Shadow: Ken pulls Diane closer, almost as if about to kiss her*

Diane: Only that was a lie. Elanor had no such intention back then.

*Shadow: Diane pushes Ken away*

Kai: How did you know that?

Diane: Elanor came to see me.

# S 3: evening Elanor

*Elanor is back, same outfit as before but this time she has a silk shaw*


```
Shows how Elanor was feeling about the whole situation
Kai finally catches Elanor in a lie. Seems like we have the killer. Elanor is wearing a silk shaw.
```

Elanor: She was not the woman, I'd expected.

Kai: What had you expected?

Elanor: I didn't expect the other woman to be someone rather awkward; she looked so normal, fuzzy sweater and hippo slippers. 

Kai: People always expects the mistress to be a beautiful seductress, but most of the time she's just a woman desperate to be loved.

Elanor: *sighs and softens her eyes*, yea, Diane... is the type to open her heart to just about anyone. *lost in a daze*

# S: Diane

Kai: Did you know who she was?

Diane: No, at first I though she was some bible peddler. They still do that you know? Go from door to door. She looked at me up and down.

*Shadows: Elanor steps forward and closes in on Diane, she puts her nose towards Diane's neck.*

Diane: Then she said "why do I smell my husband's after shave on you?" And I can tell it wasn't a question. *her face started to turn red* It all came crumbling in. *hiccup* The reality of what I thought was my romance. *hiccup* all this time his wife felt like an abstract concept, but there she was right in front of me. If she were to physically hurt me, right then and there. I would have let her.

Kai: Did she?

Diane: *started to gather herself a bit* No, she...

# S: Elanor

Elanor: I lost it and broke down crying at her doorstep that afternoon. She invited me in, a stranger, who had every reason to hurt her. She drew up a warm face towel, and brewed tea.

*Shadow Diane pulls shadow Elanor into a dance, they begin a slow mirrored choreography*

Elanor: Apparently, Ken told her that I was planning on leaving him.

Kai: Were you?

Elanor: No! At least not back then.

*Focuses on the shadows of Elanor and Diane in a dance, as they speak*

Elanor: I sometimes wonder how my life would have turned out, if Ken and I didn't get married so young.

Diane: You two were lucky, the rest of us out there are trying to find the one in an ocean of a endless choices. It's the endless choices that makes commitment hard.

Elanor: Hah, you can say that but... did you know I got into Julliard? What if I had persuade being a professional violinist instead of getting a masters in education.

Diane: Do you still play?

Elanor: I wish, if only there was more time. One thing they never tell you is that homework never ends, even if you aren't the student.

Diane: Do you regret being a teacher?

Elanor: The kids are sweet, but I mostly regret marrying. Because if I didn't our family would have let me pursue music. But they said it's better this way. Ken works very hard at stressful job, while I provide stability with mine.

Diane: Yea, his boss is always breathing down his neck.

Elanor: When he gets home, he's just a zombie. But I tell myself maybe that's ok, and maybe he won't notice, my doubts about our marriage.

Diane: How long have you been feeling this way?

Elanor: I can't remember. But when I feel this way I scold myself for not appreciating the life I do have.

Diane: You can't help the way you feel. And you can't force yourself into a feeling a certain way, just because that's what you think you should feel.

Elanor: What if the way I feel will hurt him? I can't let him know.

Diane: But he knows something is up, he seems to think you're planning to leave him.

*the music stops, the two dancers separate*

Elanor: Is that why?

Diane: *nods* I'm sorry. I shouldn't have, even if that were the case.

*The shadow dancers fade and we come back into focus with Elanor and Kai in the room*

`Elanor confronts Ken`

Kai: So Diane confirmed your suspicious...

Elanor: *nods* that night I told Ken, that I knew everything.

Kai: Did he try to deny it?

Elanor: No, *smiles* he got on his knees and begged me to forgive him.

Kai: Forgiveness is yours to give, not for him to ask for.

Elanor: There was a part of me that wanted to use this as an excuse to get a divorce. But he's the only love I've never known, so maybe it's worth a fight. He even agree to see counseling together.

Kai: Uh no, not the one next door? She's a quack, just skip the formalities and go see the one in the basement if you really want to fix your marriage.

Elanor: If only we knew that sooner... so we really tried to work things out. I told him to never see Diane again.

# S: Diane

Diane: That night Ken called me four times. The first three times, I let it go to voicemail. I knew what was coming.

Kai:  Why did you finally answer.

Diane: I guess I wanted closer. Even if I knew why, I still needed to hear the words from him.
*holds the veil on her hat over her eyes* he said he wanted to give me back my things.

# S: Elanor

Shadow Elanor: *looks over a Pucca & Garu dufflel bag* So that's everything?

Shadow Kens: *nods*

Elanor: After I give her back her things, I think great this woman will be out of our lives.
